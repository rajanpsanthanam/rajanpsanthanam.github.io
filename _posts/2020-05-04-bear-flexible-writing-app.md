---

**Hey there!**

Bear as described in their web page is a beautiful, flexible writing app for crafting notes and prose

I use Bear app on day to day basis, it completely replaced my notebook. The major reason why I use it is that, it comes handy for all my use cases.

* I need to prepare a checklist

* I need to make a TODO list
 
* I need to add bullet points on an idea
 
* I need to draft a rough document
 
* I need to takes notes while in a meeting
 
* I need to quickly write and share some markdown content

and I can go on

Putting down the key points I like and use

* Multi notes with clean navigation

* If you maintain a TODO list, progress is shown in the left nav bar itself, very helpful
 
* Search option - helpful when you have more notes written
 
* I can pin notes to the top
 
* I can add links, photos, videos
 
* I can embed code snippets 
 
* Download as markdown file in free version and other formats in paid version
 
* It auto recognise data like if you add a link, email etc
 
* Lots of keyword shortcuts!

One very strong downside I see is, its only available for mac devices. I use android phone and there is no app for it. Apart from this, it petty much solves my use cases
