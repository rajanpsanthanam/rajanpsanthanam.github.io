Figma is pretty cool product for *prototyping and designing*. The interesting part here is collaborative designing which means, you can interact over design with designers to get the thoughts clarified. How cool is that!

The product as such is *very simple*, few days with the product you will feel comfortable using it.

This is a *great toolkit* for a product person like me to talk fluent design. Most cases, there are multiple iterations which happens between product manager and designers to get the right output.

Using figma helps you get the right output in *minimal time*. It all starts with getting the UI library done for your work and then start building screens. In every step you can collabarate and reduce the back and forth.

Another important aspect is figma is completely *web based* and you just need to login! This helps you to get things done anywhere, anytime. No depedencies!

Fifma has a *free plan* to start with for up to 2 editors and 3 projects

If you are someone working with products, figma is definetly a great toolkit for you!

**Thanks for your time.**
