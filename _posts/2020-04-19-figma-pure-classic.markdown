Let me list down some pointers explaning why it is amazing


**Collaborative Designing**

Figma is pretty cool product for *prototyping and designing*. The interesting part here is collaborative designing which means, you can interact over design with designers to get the thoughts clarified. How cool is that!


**Easy to use**

The product as such is *very simple*, few days with the product you will feel comfortable using it.


**Time Saver**

This is a *great toolkit* for a product person like me to talk fluent design. Most cases, there are multiple iterations which happens between product manager and designers to get the right output.

Using figma helps you get the right output with *minimal interations*. It all starts with getting the UI library done for your work and then start building screens. In every step you can collabarate and reduce the back and forth.


**Web Based**

Another important aspect is figma is completely *web based* and you just need to login! This helps you to get things done anywhere, anytime. No depedencies!


**Free to use**

Figma has a *free plan* to start with for up to 2 editors and 3 projects. So just signup and start using!


**Prototyping**

Generally design tools just help you design and you need to use some other tool for prototying where as in figma you can do both. It works preety neat!


Now that I have given my reasons on why this tool is amazing, let me add few pointers which will give you a head start when you try figma


**Mirror App**

Figma has a mirror app which will allow you to check the look and feel of the design in actual device. It can be used for both static designs and prototyping interactions.


**Ecosystem**

You can find figma integration in many tools where you can add live embeds of your public figma files. To name few tools *jira*, *trello*, *slite*, *notion*, *dropbox*, *dribble* etc


If you are someone working with products, figma is definetly a great toolkit for you!


**Thanks for your time.**
